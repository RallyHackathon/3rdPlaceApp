Project Health Board
=========================

## Overview
Provides at-a-glance project information for use as a Rally dashboard information radiator.  Designed to answer the questions:

- Will I deliver the committed scope on time to a relase deadline?
- Does the team have impediments?
- What value has been delivered (accepted) recently and what is currently in progress?
